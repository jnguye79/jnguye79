        <h2><i>Decisions make themselves when you have enough data. If you can't decide right now, you just don't have enough data.</i> - Instagram via </h2>
        <p>With that being said, if you don't know the next direction you want to go in, that uncertainty is okay and even a natural part of life. A really important part of life is learning more about ourselves just simply by living. So go out there and try new things. When you return, you might just find that that decision is easier to make.</p>

        <p>Hi there, my name is Jimmy and I'm an upcoming graduate at the University of Maryland, College Park. As an information science major, my interests revolve around the world of data. It is within my best interest to work on projects that bring about good change for others or the world itself. That is, promote accessibility, usability, safety, and reliability.
