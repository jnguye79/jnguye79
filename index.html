        <p>
          With that being said, if you don't know the next direction you want to
          go in, that uncertainty is okay and even a natural part of life. A
          really important part of life is learning more about ourselves just
          simply by living. So go out there and try new things. When you return,
          you might just find that that decision is easier to make.

          My name is Jimmy and I'm an upcoming graduate at the
          University of Maryland, College Park. As an information science major,
          my interests revolve around the world of data. It is within my best
          interest to work on projects that bring about good change for others
          or the world itself. That is, promote accessibility, usability,
          safety, and reliability. I hope you enjoy the rest of my profile,
          please feel free to check out my recent posts!
